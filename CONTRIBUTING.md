# Guidelines for Contributing Code

New Relic welcomes code contributions by the Ruby community, and
have taken effort to make this process easy for both contributors and our
development team.

When contributing, keep in mind that the agent runs in a wide variety of Ruby
language implementations (e.g. 2.x.x, jruby, etc.) as well as a wide variety of
application environments (e.g. Rails, Sinatra, roll-your-own, etc.) See [Ruby agent requirements and supported frameworks](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/ruby-agent-requirements-supported-frameworks)
for the current full list.

Because of this, we need to be more defensive in our coding practices than most
projects. Syntax must be compatible with all supported Ruby implementations and
we can't assume the presence of any specific libraries, including `ActiveSupport`,
`ActiveRecord`, etc.

## Process

### Version Support

When contributing, keep in mind that New Relic customers (that's you!) are
running many different versions of Ruby, some of them pretty old. Changes that
depend on the newest version of Ruby will probably be rejected, especially if
they replace something backwards compatible.

Be aware that the instrumentation needs to work with a wide range of versions of
the instrumented modules, and that code that looks nonsensical or
overcomplicated may be that way for compatibility-related reasons. Read all the
comments and check the related tests before deciding whether existing code is
incorrect.

If you are planning on contributing a new feature or an otherwise complex
contribution, we kindly ask you to start a conversation with the maintainer team
by opening up a GitHub issue first.


### General Guidelines
The Ruby agent avoids requiring any dependencies in the main agent code base.
Instrumentations and features that would otherwise require a dependency (such as
Infinite Tracing, which require gRPC and protobuf) are built as separate gems.
If you have a feature or instrumentation request that would require a
dependency, please open an Issue to discuss with the maintainers before
proceeding.

Your code will be evaluated for completeness and accuracy in
implementation and must be accompanied with appropriate unit tests.  New
additions that do not break existing tests are the easiest and quickest to be
accepted and merged.  New features and improvements that break existing
functionality are slower to be accepted and merged as they require agreement
with maintainers across a majority of the languages New Relic supports.  Any
such breaking changes will require a major version bump whereas non-breaking
additions only lead to minor version bumps.

Please be aware that the maintainers of New Relic’s agents aim to have as much
commonality of functionality across all language agents as makes sense, so we are
always working to reconcile language-specific changes against the cross-language
community set of agreements.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests should be submitted in the [Issue tracker](../../issues), with
a description of the expected behavior & use case. Before submitting an Issue,
please search for similar ones in the [closed
issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

### Pull Requests

We can only accept PRs for version v6.12.0 or greater due to open source
licensing restrictions. Please set the merge branch to `dev` unless the issue
states otherwise.

### Code of Conduct

Before contributing please read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Note that our [code of conduct](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all platforms
and venues related to this project; please follow it in all your interactions
with the project and its participants.

## Branches

The head of `main` will generally have New Relic's latest release. However,
New Relic reserves the ability to push an edge to the `main`. If you download a
release from this repo, use the appropriate tag. New Relic usually pushes beta
versions of a release to a working branch before tagging them for General
Availability.

The `main` branch houses the code from the latest release. The `dev` branch
includes unreleased work. Please create all new branches off of `dev`.

## Development Environment Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo locally
    - Fork the repository inside GitHub
    - `git clone git@github.com:<gh username>/newrelic-ruby-agent.git`
1. Pick a Ruby version
    - Use rbenv, rvm, chruby, asdf, etc. to install any version of Ruby between 2.2 up to the latest stable version
1. Install development dependencies
    - `bundle install`
1. Check that your env is setup correctly
    - `bundle exec rake`

**Optional:** Install [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) to
integrate our team's git hooks, such as [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop)
linting into your workflow.

**Note:** These setup instructions will not allow you to run the entire test
suite. Some of our suites require services such as MySQL, Postgres, Redis, and
others to run.

## Testing

The agent includes a suite of unit and functional tests which should be used to
verify your changes don't break existing functionality.

Unit tests are stored in the `test/new_relic` directory.

Functional tests are stored in the `test/multiverse` directory.

### Running Tests

Running the test suite is simple.  Just invoke:

    bundle
    bundle exec rake

This will run the unit tests in standalone mode. You can run against a specific Rails version
by passing the version name (which should match the name of a subdirectory in test/environments)
as an argument to the test:env rake task, like this:

bundle exec rake 'test:env[rails60]'

These tests are setup to run automatically in
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/actions) under several
Ruby implementations. When you've pushed your changes to GitHub, you can confirm that
the GitHub Actions test matrix passes for your fork.

Additionally, our own CI jobs runs these tests under multiple versions of Rails
to verify compatibility.

### Writing Tests

For most contributions it is strongly recommended to add additional tests which
exercise your changes.

This helps us efficiently incorporate your changes into our mainline codebase
and provides a safeguard that your change won't be broken by future development.

There are some rare cases where code changes do not result in changed
functionality (e.g. a performance optimization) and new tests are not required.
In general, including tests with your pull request dramatically increases the
chances it will be accepted.

### Functional Testing

For cases where the unit test environment is not sufficient for testing a
change (e.g. instrumentation for a non-Rails framework, not available in the
unit test environment), we have a functional testing suite called multiverse.
These tests can be run by invoking:

    bundle
    bundle exec rake test:multiverse

More details are available in
[test/multiverse/README.md](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/blob/main/test/multiverse/README.md).

### Leveraging Docker for Development and/or Testing
