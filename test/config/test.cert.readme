The self-signed certificate file and key file used for testing were generated by
OpenSSL v1.1.1f on an Ubuntu 20.04 container with the following command and
inputs. NOTE that because the common name (CN) value of the certificate must match
that of the server host using it, a value of "localhost" is used. If the
server's hostname does not match the CN value, then an OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER
related error will occur.

# openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 7300
