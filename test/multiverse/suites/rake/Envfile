# NOTE:  Effective July, 2020, all the older versions of Rake prior to 12.3.3 are 
#        eliminated from the test suite due to security vulnerability.  Because of 
#        this and the fact that rake 12.3.3 supports Rubies going back to 2.0.0
#        users are encouraged to upgrade their rake version to 12.3.3 rather than
#        continue to rely on older versions of rake.  
#
# NOTE:  older versions of rake going back to 10.0.0 are presumed to continue to work
#        as no code changes were made to deprecate.  However, do be aware that over 
#        time these versions may cease to work if we change instrumentation around rake
#        in the future.

# These two are kept as comments to mark oldest supported and latest unsupported.
# There are no plans to re-enable these going forward.
