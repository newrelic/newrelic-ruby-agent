  #
  # Regression test for
  #   https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/issues/1639
  #
  # PR 1611 introduced a new `call_pipelined_with_tracing` method to
  # `lib/new_relic/agent/instrumentation/redis/instrumentation.rb`. That method
  # is defined on all instrumented instances of RedisClient (defined by the
  # `redis-client` gem) when v5.0+ of the `redis` gem (which requires
  # `redis-client`) is used. Originally the new method performed a
  # `client.db` call on `self` to get at the client's configured database value.
  # At the time, `client` was assumed to always return an instance of
  # `Redis::Client` which is a class defined by the `redis` gem. This
  # `Redis::Client` class has a `db` helper method that exposes the configured
  # database value.
  #
  # With Issue 1639 it was discovered that `client` could return an instance
  # of `RedisClient` (defined by the `redis-client` gem) instead of
  # `Redis::Client` (defined by the `redis` gem). The original `client.db` call
  # was updated to read `client.config.db` instead. This approach is known to
  # work for instances of `RedisClient` and `Redis::Client`, as
  # `Redis::Client#db` is just a helper method that calls `config.db`.
  #
  # This test reproduces the problem by placing an instance of `RedisClient` in
  # scope when the `call_pipelined_with_tracing` method calls `client`, and
  # confirms that the instrumentation no longer (and never again) errors out.
  #
  # NOTE: Because Sidekiq v7.0+ can use `redis-client` without `redis`, this
  #       test brings in the `redis` gem directly via `bundler/inline`

  # Sidekiq v7.0 depends on the redis-client gem and by default will not have

  # has Sidekiq v7.0 but does not have the redis gem present. We will then
  # introduce the redis gem to the environment and ensure that things still
  # work as expected.
