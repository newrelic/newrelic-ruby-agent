# applications with deep visibility and low overhead.  For more information,

# here are the settings that are common to all environments
common: &default_settings

  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
  # You must specify the licence key associated with your New Relic account.
  # This key binds your Agent's data to your account in the New Relic RPM service.

  #license_key: 'bootstrap_newrelic_admin_license_key_000'
  #host: localhost

  host: localhost

  # Agent Enabled
  # Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run.
  # Default is 'auto' which means the agent will install and run only if a
  # valid dispatcher such as Mongrel is running.  This prevents it from running
  # with Rake or the console.  Set to false to completely turn the agent off
  # regardless of the other settings.  Valid values are true, false and auto.
  # agent_enabled: auto
  
  # Application Name
  # Set this to be the name of your application as you'd like it show up in RPM.
  # RPM will then auto-map instances of your application into a RPM "application"
  # on your home dashboard page. This setting does not prevent you from manually
  # defining applications.
  app_name: Rails 3 view test ap

  # When 'enabled' is turned on, the agent collects performance data by inserting lightweight
  # tracers on key methods inside the rails framework and asynchronously aggregating
  # and reporting this performance data to the NewRelic RPM service at newrelic.com.
  enabled: false

  # The newrelic agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information
  # separate from that of your application.  Specify its log level here.
  log_level: debug
  
  # The newrelic agent communicates with the RPM service via http by default.
  # If you want to communicate via https to increase security, then turn on
  # SSL by setting this value to true.  Note, this will result in increased
  # CPU overhead to perform the encryption involved in SSL communication, but this
  # work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so
  # it should not impact response times.
  ssl: false
  
  # Set your application's Apdex threshold value with the 'apdex_t' setting, in seconds. The
  # apdex_t value determines the buckets used to compute your overall Apdex score. Requests
  # that take less than apdex_t seconds to process will be classified as Satisfying transactions;
  # more than apdex_t seconds as Tolerating transactions; and more than four times the apdex_t 
  # value as Frustrating transactions. For more
  # about the Apdex standard, see http://support.newrelic.com/faqs/general/apdex
  apdex_t: 1.0
    

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the RPM server.
  #
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required.  Other settings are optional.  Default
  # port is 8080.

  # proxy_host: hostname
  # proxy_port: 8080
  # proxy_user:

  # Tells transaction tracer and error collector (when enabled) whether or not to capture HTTP params. 
  # When true, the RoR filter_parameter_logging mechanism is used so that sensitive parameters are not recorded
  capture_params: false


  # Transaction tracer captures deep information about slow
  # transactions and sends this to the RPM service once a minute. Included in the
  # transaction is the exact call sequence of the transactions including any SQL statements
  # issued.
  transaction_tracer:
  
    # Transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. This feature
    # is only available at the Silver and above product levels.
    enabled: true
    
    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of
    # a controller action exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent
    # to RPM. Valid values are any float value, or (default) "apdex_f", which will use the
    # threshold for an dissatisfying Apdex controller action - four times the Apdex T value.
    transaction_threshold: apdex_f
 
    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder
    # has three modes, "off" which sends no SQL, "raw" which sends the SQL statement in its 
    # original form, and "obfuscated", which strips out numeric and string literals
    record_sql: obfuscated
    
    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL call. In other words, 
    # when SQL statements exceed this threshold, then capture and send to RPM the current
    # stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from  
    stack_trace_threshold: 0.500
  
  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to RPM for
  # viewing
  error_collector:
    
    # Error collector is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. This feature
    # is only available at the Silver and above product levels
    enabled: true
    
    # Tells error collector whether or not to capture a source snippet around the place of the
    # error when errors are View related.
    capture_source: true    
    
    # To stop specific errors from reporting to RPM, set this property to comma separated 
    # values
    #
    #ignore_errors: ActionController::RoutingError, ...

  # (Advanced) Uncomment this to ensure the cpu and memory samplers won't run.  Useful when you
  # are using the agent to monitor an external resource
  # disable_samplers: true

# override default settings based on your application's environment

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide newrelic conifguration settings for these enviromnents here.

development:
  <<: *default_settings
  # turn off communication to RPM service in development mode.
  # NOTE: for initial evaluation purposes, you may want to temporarily turn
  # the agent on in development mode.
  enabled: true

  # When running in Developer Mode, the New Relic Agent will present 
  # performance information on the last 100 transactions you have 
  # executed since starting the mongrel.  to view this data, go to 
  # http://localhost:3000/newrelic

  # it almost never makes sense to turn on the agent when running unit, functional or
  # integration tests or the like.
  enabled: true

# Turn on the agent in production for 24x7 monitoring.  NewRelic testing shows
# an average performance impact of < 5 ms per transaction, you you can leave this on
# all the time without incurring any user-visible performance degredation.
production:
  <<: *default_settings
  enabled: true

# many applications have a staging environment which behaves identically to production.
# Support for that environment is provided here.  By default, the staging environment has
# the agent turned on.
