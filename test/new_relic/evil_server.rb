# This is a simple TCP server that binds to an ephemeral port, accepts
# incoming connections on that port, and then closes those connections
# immediately thereafter.
#
# Its purpose is to emulate a misbehaving HTTP server (or flaky network
# connection) by closing the TCP connection without sending an HTTP response.
