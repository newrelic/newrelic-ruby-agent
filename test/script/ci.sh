# Script to run test suites in CI or in development mode.  This script handles
# checking out test dependencies (currently rpm_test_app and its dependencies)
# and executing them.
#
# It relies on 2 environment variables:
#
# RUBY - The rbenv ruby you want to use (e.g. 1.8.7, ree, jruby)
#
# BRANCH - The rpm_test_app branch you want to use (e.g. rails20, rails31)
#
# Example usage:
# RUBY=ree BRANCH=rails20 test/script/ci.sh
#
# RUBY=ree BRANCH=rails20 test/script/ci.sh
#
# RUBY=jruby BRANCH=rails22 test/script/ci.sh

# FIXME:  Here we actually trigger the tests. Since the agent deals so heavily
# in units of time we have many tests that assert that durations are measured
# correctly.  These almost always pass, but as the CI machine has come under
# heavier load there tend to be discrepencies between the duration measured in
# the test and the duration the agent measures.  This is due to lags in CPU
# scheduling since many processes are running on the box simultaneously.
# To reduce the noise from these sporardic failures we rerun the test suite if
# there are failures to see if they are transient (instead of re-running it by
# hand).  Ultimately we'll move towards a more elegant solution.
