# Overview
Describe the changes present in the pull request

# Related Github Issue
Include a link to the related GitHub issue, if applicable

# Testing
The agent includes a suite of unit and functional tests which should be used to
verify your changes don't break existing functionality. These tests will run with 
Github Actions when a pull request is made. More details on running the tests locally can be found 
[here for our unit tests](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/blob/main/test/README.md), 
and [here for our functional tests](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/blob/main/test/multiverse/README.md).
For most contributions it is strongly recommended to add additional tests which
exercise your changes.
