# The Client class manages the streaming buffer with respect to the gRPC Connection.
#
# Restarting the client will cause a new connection to the gRPC server.
# When the client is restarted, a new streaming buffer is started and contents of old
# buffer are transferred to the new buffer.  
#
# Suspending the client will prevent the client from attempting to reconnect to the 
# gRPC server, but will still continue to record the span events `seen` metric.
