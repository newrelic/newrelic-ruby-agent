# Rake task for running Ruby agent multiverse tests. This file may be required
# from third party gems. It is also used by the agent itself to run multiverse.
#
# Multiverse tests are grouped in (potentially multiverse) "suite" directories.
# These suites are found by default under ./test/multiverse. That location can
# be overridden with ENV['SUITES_DIRECTORY'].
#
# The first parameter to this task is a suite directory name to run.  If
# excluded, multiverse will run all suites it finds.
#
# Additional parameters are allowed to multiverse. Many parameters can be
# combined.
#
# Some examples:
#
#   # Runs ./test/multiverse/*
#   bundle exec rake test:multiverse
#
#   # Runs ./test/multiverse/my_gem
#   bundle exec rake test:multiverse[my_gem]
#
#   # With verbose logging and debugging via pry
#   bundle exec rake test:multiverse[my_gem,verbose,debug]
#
#   # Runs only first set of gems defined in my_gem's Envfile
#   bundle exec rake test:multiverse[my_gem,env=0]
#
#   # Runs tests matching the passed name (via Minitest's built-in filtering)
#   bundle exec rake test:multiverse[my_gem,name=MyGemTest]
#
#   # Runs with a specific test seed
#   bundle exec rake test:multiverse[my_gem,seed=1337]
