# This module includes utilities for manipulating URIs, particularly from the
# context of Net::HTTP requests. We don't always have direct access to the full
# URI from our instrumentation points in Net::HTTP, and we want to filter out
# some URI parts before saving URIs from instrumented calls - logic for that
# lives here.
