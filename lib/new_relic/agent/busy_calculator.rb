    # This module supports calculation of actual time spent processing requests over the course of
    # one harvest period.  It's similar to what you would get if you just added up all the
    # execution times of controller calls, however that will be inaccurate when requests
    # span the minute boundaries.  This module manages accounting of requests not yet
    # completed.
    #
    # Calls are re-entrant.  All start calls must be paired with finish
    # calls, or a reset call.
