# This class represents a set of metrics that were recorded during a single
# transaction. Since the name of the transaction is not known until its end, we
# don't save explicit scopes with these metrics, we just keep separate
# collections of scoped and unscoped metrics.

      # only by their entries in the @scoped Hash, and it's up to clients to
      # propagate them into unscoped metrics as well when instances of this
      # class are merged into the global metric store.
