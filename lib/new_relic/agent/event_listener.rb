module NewRelic::Agent
  # Basic mechanism for the agent instance to provide agent-wide eventing.
  # It is intended to keep different pieces of the app decoupled from each other.
  #
  # While an EventListener could be used elsewhere, it's strongly expected
  # your eventing needs should be met by the agent's instance.
