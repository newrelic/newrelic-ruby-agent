# The GC::Profiler class available on MRI has to be reset periodically to avoid
# memory "leaking" in the underlying implementation. However, it's a major
# bummer for how we want to gather those statistics.
#
# This class comes to the rescue. It relies on being the only party to reset
# the underlying GC::Profiler, but otherwise gives us a steadily increasing
# total time.
