      # Update the unscoped metrics given in metric_names.
      # metric_names may be either a single name, or an array of names.
      #
      # This is an internal method, subject to change at any time. Client apps
      # and gems should use the public API (NewRelic::Agent.record_metric)
      # instead.
      #
      # There are four ways to use this method:
      #
      # 1. With a numeric value, it will update the Stats objects associated
      #    with the given metrics by calling record_data_point(value, aux).
      #    aux will be treated in this case as the exclusive time associated
      #    with the call being recorded.
      #
      # 2. With a value of :apdex_s, :apdex_t, or :apdex_f, it will treat the
      #    associated stats as an Apdex metric, updating it to reflect the
      #    occurrence of a transaction falling into the given category.
      #    The aux value in this case should be the apdex threshold used in
      #    bucketing the request.
      #
      # 3. If a block is given, value and aux will be ignored, and instead the
      #    Stats object associated with each named unscoped metric will be
      #    yielded to the block for customized update logic.
      #
      # 4. If value is a Stats instance, it will be merged into the Stats
      #    associated with each named unscoped metric.
      #
      # If this method is called during a transaction, the metrics will be
      # attached to the Transaction, and not merged into the global set until
      # the end of the transaction.
      #
      # Otherwise, the metrics will be recorded directly into the global set
      # of metrics, under a lock.
