# A Sampler is used to capture meaningful metrics in a background thread
# periodically.  They will be invoked about once a minute, each time the agent
# sends data to New Relic's servers.
#
# Samplers can be added to New Relic by subclassing NewRelic::Agent::Sampler.
# Instances are created when the agent is enabled and installed.  Subclasses
# are registered for instantiation automatically.
