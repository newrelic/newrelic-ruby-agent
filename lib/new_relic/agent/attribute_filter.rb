# This class applies filtering rules as specified in the Agent Attributes
# cross-agent spec.
#
# Instances of it are constructed by deriving a set of rules from the agent
# configuration. Instances are immutable once they are constructed - if the
# config changes, a new instance should be constructed and swapped in to
# replace the existing one.
#
# The #apply method is the main external interface of this class. It takes an
# attribute name and a set of default destinations (represented as a bitfield)
# and returns a set of actual destinations after applying the filtering rules
# specified in the config.
#
# Each set of destinations is represented as a bitfield, where the bit positions
# specified in the DST_* constants are used to indicate whether an attribute
# should be sent to the corresponding destination.
#
# The choice of a bitfield here rather than an Array was made to avoid the need
# for any transient object allocations during the application of rules. Since
# rule application will happen once per attribute per transaction, this is a hot
# code path.
#
# The algorithm for applying filtering rules is as follows:
#
# 1. Start with a bitfield representing the set of default destinations passed
#    in to #apply.
# 2. Mask this bitfield against the set of destinations that have attribute
#    enabled at all.
# 3. Traverse the list of rules in order (more on the ordering later), applying
#    each matching rule, but taking care to not let rules override the enabled
#    status of each destination. Each matching rule may mutate the bitfield.
# 4. Return the resulting bitfield after all rules have been applied.
#
# Each rule consists of a name, a flag indicating whether it ends with a
# wildcard, a bitfield representing the set of destinations that it applies to,
# and a flag specifying whether it is an include or exclude rule.
#
# During construction, rules are sorted according to the following criteria:
#
# 1. First, the names are compared lexicographically. This has the impact of
#    forcing shorter (more general) rules towards the top of the list and longer
#    (more specific) rules towards the bottom. This is important, because the
#    Agent Attributes spec stipulates that the most specific rule for a given
#    destination should take precedence. Since rules are applied top-to-bottom,
#    this sorting guarantees that the most specific rule will be applied last.
# 2. If the names are identical, we next examine the wildcard flag. Rules ending
#    with a wildcard are considered more general (and thus 'less than') rules
#    not ending with a wildcard.
# 3. If the names and wildcard flags are identical, we next examine whether the
#    rules being compared are include or exclude rules. Exclude rules have
#    precedence by the spec, so they are considered 'greater than' include
#    rules.
#
# This approach to rule evaluation was taken from the PHP agent's
# implementation.
