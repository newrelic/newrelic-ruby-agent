    # This module contains helper methods related to Distributed
    # Tracing, an APM feature that ties together traces from multiple
    # apps in one view.  Use it to add distributed tracing to protocols
    # not already supported by the agent.

      # distributed trace. This method should be called every time an outbound call is made
      # since the header payload contains a timestamp.
      #
      # Distributed Tracing must be enabled to use this method.

      # Accepts distributed tracing headers from any source that has been packaged 
      # as a Ruby Hash, thereby allowing the user to manually inject distributed
      # tracing headers.  It is optimized to process +HTTP_TRACEPARENT+, +HTTP_TRACESTATE+, 
      # and +HTTP_NEWRELIC+ as the given Hash keys.  which is the most common scenario 
      # from Rack middleware in most Ruby applications.  However, the Hash keys are 
      # case-insensitive and the "HTTP_" prefixes may also be omitted.
      #
      # Calling this method is not necessary in a typical HTTP trace as
      # distributed tracing is already handled by the agent.

      # When used, invoke this method as early as possible in a transaction's life-cycle
      # as calling after the headers are already created will have no effect.

      # This method accepts both W3C trace context and New Relic distributed tracing headers.
      # When both are present, only the W3C headers are utilized.  When W3C trace context
