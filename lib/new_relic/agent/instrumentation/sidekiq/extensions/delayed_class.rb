# TODO: remove this class once Sidekiq v6 is no longer supported.
#       Delayed extensions are disabled by default in Sidekiq 5 and 6 and
#       were removed entirely in Sidekiq 7.
#
#       see https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5076 for the discussion
#       of the removal, which includes mentions of alternatives
