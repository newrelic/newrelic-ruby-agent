  #
  # EXCON_MIN_VERSION is the minimum version we attempt to instrument at all.
  #
  # Why don't we use Excon.defaults[:instrumentor]?
  # While this might seem a perfect fit, it unfortunately isn't suitable in
  # current form. Someone might reasonably set the default instrumentor to
  # something else after we install our instrumentation. Ideally, excon would
  # itself conform to the #subscribe interface of ActiveSupport::Notifications,
  # so we could safely subscribe and not be clobbered by future subscribers,
  # but alas, it does not yet.
