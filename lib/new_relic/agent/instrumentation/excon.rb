  # We have two ways of instrumenting Excon:
  # - For newer versions, use the middleware mechanism Excon exposes
  # - For older versions, monkey-patch Excon::Connection#request
  #
  # EXCON_MIN_VERSION is the minimum version we attempt to instrument at all.
  # EXCON_MIDDLEWARE_MIN_VERSION is the min version we use the newer
  #   instrumentation for.
  #
  # Note that middlewares were added to Excon prior to 0.19, but we don't
  # use middleware-based instrumentation prior to that version because it didn't
  # expose a way for middlewares to know about request failures.
  #
  # Why don't we use Excon.defaults[:instrumentor]?
  # While this might seem a perfect fit, it unfortunately isn't suitable in
  # current form. Someone might reasonably set the default instrumentor to
  # something else after we install our instrumentation. Ideally, excon would
  # itself conform to the #subscribe interface of ActiveSupport::Notifications,
  # so we could safely subscribe and not be clobbered by future subscribers,
  # but alas, it does not yet.
