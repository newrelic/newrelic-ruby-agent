      # for situations that the simpler NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace can't
      # properly handle.

      #   statement-level metrics (i.e. table or model name)

      #   running the datastore block. Receives three arguments: result of the
      #   yield, the most specific (scoped) metric name, and elapsed time of the
      #   call. An example use is attaching SQL to Transaction Traces at the end
      #   of a wrapped datastore call.
