  # This middleware is used internally by the agent in the rare case

  # is true.  In Rails and Sinatra applications this middleware will be
  # automatically injected if necessary.
  #
  # If you have disabled middleware instrumentation and are not using Rails or
  # Sinatra you can include this middleware manually in your config.ru file.
  #
  # All of the functionality of this module resides in the MiddlewareTracing
  # module, which is shared between it and our third party middleware
  # instrumentation.
