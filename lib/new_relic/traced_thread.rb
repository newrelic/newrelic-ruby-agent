module NewRelic
  #
  # This class allows the current transaction to be passed to a Thread so that nested segments can be created from the operations performed within the Thread's block.
  # To have the New Relic Ruby agent automatically trace all of your applications threads,
  # enable the +instrumentation.thread.tracing+ configuration option in your newrelic.yml.
  #
  # Note: disabling the configuration option +instrumentation.thread+ while using this class can cause incorrectly nested spans.
  #
  # @api public
  class TracedThread < Thread
    #
    # Creates a new Thread whose work will be traced by New Relic.
    # Use this class as a replacement for the native Thread class.
    # Example: Instead of using +Thread.new+, use:
    #
    #     NewRelic::TracedThread.new { execute_some_code }
    #
    # @api public
