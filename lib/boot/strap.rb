# This file is designed to bootstrap a `Bundler.require`-based Ruby app (such as
# a Ruby on Rails app) so the app can be instrumented and observed by the
# New Relic Ruby agent without the agent being added to the app as a dependency.
# NOTE: introducing the agent into your application via bootstrap is in beta.
# Use at your own risk.
#
# Given a production-ready Ruby app that optionally has a pre-packaged "frozen"
# or "deployment"â€“gem bundle, the New Relic Ruby agent can be introduced
# to the app without modifying the app and keeping all of the app's content
# read-only.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Ruby (tested v2.4+)
#   - Bundler (included with Ruby, tested v1.17+)
#
# Instructions:
#   - First, make sure the New Relic Ruby agent exists on disk. For these
#     instructions, we'll assume the agent exists at `/newrelic`.
#     - The agent can be downloaded as the "newrelic_rpm" gem from RubyGems.org
#       and unpacked with "gem unpack"
#     - The agent can be cloned from the New Relic public GitHub repo:
#       https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent
#   - Next, use the "RUBYOPT" environment variable to require ("-r") this
#     file (note that the ".rb" extension is dropped):
#       ```
#       export RUBYOPT="-r /newrelic/lib/boot/strap"
#       ```
#    - Add your New Relic license key as an environment variable.
#       ```
#       export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=1a2b3c4d5e67f8g9h0i
#       ```
#   - Launch an existing Ruby app as usual. For a Ruby on Rails app, this might
#     involve running `bin/rails server`.
#   - In the Ruby app's directory, look for and inspect
#     `log/newrelic_agent.log`. If this file exists and there are no "WARN" or
#     "ERROR" entries within it, then the agent was successfully introduced to
#     the Ruby application.
