# New Relic Ruby Agent

The New Relic Ruby agent monitors your applications to help you
[identify and solve performance issues](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-ruby#monitor-performance).
You can also extend the agent's performance monitoring to
[collect and analyze business data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-ruby#business-data)
to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions.

The New Relic Ruby agent is dual-purposed as either a Gem or a Rails plugin,
hosted on [github](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent).

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/newrelic_rpm.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/newrelic_rpm)

## Supported Environments

An up-to-date list of Ruby versions and frameworks for the latest agent
can be found on [our docs site](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/supported-frameworks).

You can also monitor non-web applications. Refer to the "Other
Environments" section below.

## Installing and Using

The latest released gem for the Ruby agent can be found at [Rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/newrelic_rpm)

### Quick Start

#### With Bundler

For using with Bundler, add the Ruby agent to your project's Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'newrelic_rpm'
```

and run `bundle install` to activate the new gem.

#### Without Bundler

If you are not using Bundler, install the gem with:

```bash
gem install newrelic_rpm
```

and then require the New Relic Ruby agent in your Ruby start-up sequence:

```ruby
require 'newrelic_rpm'
```

#### Other Environments

Assuming you have installed the agent per above, you may also need to tell the Ruby agent to start for some frameworks and non-framework environments. To do so, add the following to your Ruby start-up sequence start the agent:

```ruby
NewRelic::Agent.manual_start
```
