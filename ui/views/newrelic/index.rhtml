			<h3>Welcome</h3>
			<p>
			Welcome to <b>New Relic RPM Developer Mode</b>.  This Rails extension traces the performance activity
			of your 100 most recent controller actions in your rails application, and presents the performance
			information for your analysis.
			</p>
			<p>
			The url's of the most recent transactions are presented to the left, most-recent first.  Click
			on any one of these to drill down and inspect its performance information.
			</p>
			<p>
			The identical agent technology that provides this data is also capable of monitoring your application as it
       runs in production.  For more information, visit <a href="http://www.newrelic.com">http://www.newrelic.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Note, to increase the accuracy of our performance measurement, we automatically "strip out" any
			time spent in application code loading, which will not happen when your application runs in 
			production mode.
